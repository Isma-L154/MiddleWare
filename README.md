# MiddleWare

What is a Middleware? A middleware is a software component that sits between the request and response pipeline in a web application. Its main role is to process incoming HTTP requests before they reach the application logic, and/or process outgoing responses before they are sent to the client.

In simpler terms, middleware acts like a filter or layer that can:

Authenticate or authorize users Log request and response data Handle exceptions and errors Modify requests/responses Manage sessions, CORS, headers, etc.
